A super-simple web app that you can use to generate cool, weird, and beautiful text using pseudofonts made with Unicode characters. This is the GUI-based equivalent of the [Fancy Fonts Bot](https://github.com/waterrmalann/telegram-fancy-fonts-bot) for Telegram that I wrote not too long ago. They are both similar in terms of functionality and the font system is cross-compatible. It's written in HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript with no dependencies.

It uses a system of pseudofonts where similar looking strings of unicode symbols are used to replace the entire english alphabet to create a fake font. I've described it in detail [in this article](@/blog/unicode-pseudofonts/index.md).

**Note:** *Text generated using this application may not always be readable, they could also cause accessibility issues as screen-readers might not recognize them. So it is advised that you use them knowing the downsides.*
