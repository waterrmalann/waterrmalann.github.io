+++

A chatbot written for both Discord and Telegram that can provide prompts and questions to play conversational games with to help keep chats interesting and active. I've written an [article on it](@/blog/conversational-games-bot.md) if you wish to learn more. 

The Telegram version of the chatbot was written in Python using the [python-telegram-bot](https://pypi.org/project/python-telegram-bot/) library. The Discord bot also uses Python but relies on the [Discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) library to interface with Discord APIs. Both bots are identical in terms of functionality but have been written in a way so that they adapt to the style of both platforms.

#### Available Games

- **Truth Or Dare**
- **Never Have I Ever**
- **[Would You Rather](http://either.io/)**

### On Github
